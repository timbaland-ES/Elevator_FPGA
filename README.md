This is one of my private FPGA-Projects

IDE: AMD Xilinx Vivado
Hardware: FPGA Dev-Board Diligent Arty S7 with a Xinlinx Spartan 7 FPGA

The aim was to creat a FPGA-Prototype for a elevator circuit. It gets the input from several Sensors, and the 
logic answers if the elevator should drive one floor up, or down.
